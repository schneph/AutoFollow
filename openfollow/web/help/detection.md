# Person Detection

> **Experimental** – accuracy, model defaults, and the configuration surface may change between releases. Do not rely on detection for show-critical paths.

Experimental YOLO-based person detection that finds people in the camera frame and can automatically steer your markers. It ships ready to run: the quality-tier models are pre-installed and detection starts as soon as you pick a tracking mode.

> **Performance.** Person detection is compute-heavy and does **not** run efficiently on a Raspberry Pi 5 today – a more powerful workstation is recommended for it. It is also not suited to very crowded scenes (many overlapping people). Where it shines is tracking an individual actor: it reacts faster than a human operator and can sharpen the marker's position once you have parked the assist anchor on the right person.

## Dependencies

Nothing to install: the inference backend (onnxruntime + opencv) is bundled in the macOS app and the Raspberry Pi image, so detection runs offline out of the box.

If the backend isn't present (a source checkout, or a base-only build), install it into the app venv: `bash scripts/install-detection.sh` from a checkout, or `bash /usr/share/openfollow/install-detection.sh` on a packaged install.

It checks free space, uses the NVMe when present, and restarts the service. Idempotent. Add `--with-export` on a workstation for the model-export tools (torch + ultralytics) the **Download Model** action uses; those are large, AGPL, and not needed on a show Pi. **Download Model** also needs an internet connection, because it fetches the YOLO weights before exporting them, so it cannot run on an offline show network: export on a workstation and copy the `.onnx` across. See https://openfollow.app/docs/detection-install.html.

If the red "Detection needs extra components" banner shows, the backend isn't installed; run that command, then reload.

## Tracking

The Tracking control is the master on/off for the whole feature. Choosing **AI Assisted**, **Fully Automatic** or **All Performers** turns person detection on automatically; **Off** turns it off.

- **Off** – no detection runs; no CPU cost.
- **AI Assisted** – the default. Detection refines **all of your controlled markers** at once. For each marker there are two things on screen: a **manual anchor** (the solid marker, with its card, that you steer with keyboard / gamepad / mouse) and the **AI-corrected output** (a dim crosshair + ground ring – the position actually broadcast on PSN and used for zones). The output continuously *glides* – it never snaps – onto the detected person **nearest your anchor** (within **Assist radius**), or back toward the anchor when nobody is in range. You choose *who* each marker follows by parking its anchor near them; the AI supplies the precise, jitter-free position. Because the anchor is independent, you can move it away at any time and the output follows. This works for every operator's marker simultaneously.
- **Fully Automatic** – hands-off, for a single marker. Detection picks the largest visible person, then sticks to *that* person frame to frame (tracked across frames), holding through brief occlusions. If their track is briefly lost or re-numbered it re-locks onto the person nearest where it last followed them; only once they stay gone past the **Grace period** (or at a cold start) does it fall back to picking the largest. **Follow marker** chooses which marker it drives. On PSN, the marker's tracker status reports how much detection vouches for the position (see **Tracker Status** under **PSN Output**).

- **All Performers** – hands-off, for everyone on stage. Every person who walks into view (inside the detection masks, if you use them) gets a controlled marker of their own, with no operator. A newcomer takes the lowest free marker, so the first person on is Marker 1, the next Marker 2, and so on; the most confident detection goes first when several arrive together. A marker stays with its person while the tracker holds them, including through brief occlusions. When a person leaves or is lost past the **Grace period**, their marker holds its last position, reports itself invalid on PSN, and is free again. If someone then appears within **Re-acquire radius** of where they were lost (for example, the same performer after the tracker re-numbered them), they resume that marker instead of taking the lowest free one. Markers with nobody on them also report invalid. When there are more people than controlled markers, the extra people wait until a marker frees up. Add markers under **Controlled markers** to follow more people.

  To have one followspot follow the performer you choose, pick a **Spotlight marker**: a controlled marker that is left out of the performer pool and copies the position of one performer's marker. Patch your desk's followspot to the spotlight marker, then choose whom it follows with **Follow** in the performers list under the setting, or with the next / previous marker keys on the Operator Screen (Tab by default, or the D-Pad on a gamepad), which step through the performers being tracked. When you switch, the spotlight glides across to the new performer instead of jumping, then tracks them exactly. While the performer it follows has nobody on them, the spotlight holds where it is and reports itself invalid on PSN. On the Operator Screen each performer's box is labelled with its marker's name, the followed performer's box is drawn heavier and labelled **FOLLOW**, and the marker cards read **FOLLOWED** and **SPOT > name**.

Under every mode the detector runs a **tracking-by-detection** pipeline: each detection is bound to a persistent track with a stable identity, and a motion model predicts every track forward using the real time elapsed between frames (so a dropped frame or a fast mover doesn't throw it off). That matching is what lets a person who is briefly occluded, or who steps into shadow and dims, keep the same track instead of being dropped and re-numbered on reacquisition.

- **Follow marker** – *(Fully Automatic only)* which marker detection drives. **Currently selected (controller)** follows whichever marker the operator has selected; a specific marker ID pins detection to that marker regardless of controller selection.
- **Track** – which part of the bounding box gives the marker position: **Head (top of person)** or **Feet (floor position)**. Choose whichever the show geometry references.
- **Smoothing (0–1)** – exponential smoothing on the pinned marker position. In **AI Assisted** mode this is also the **glide speed**: how fast each output marker eases toward its person (or back to its anchor). Lower is smoother / laggier; higher is more responsive (never instant – the output is always smoothed, never snapped). `0.1`–`0.2` feels natural. Default `0.15`.
- **Prediction** – velocity lookahead multiplier that extrapolates the marker's trajectory to compensate for detection lag on fast movers, 0–20. `0` disables prediction. The lookahead and smoothing are frame-rate-independent, so the feel is the same on a fast workstation and a slower Pi. Default `8.0`.
- **Grace period (ms)** – how long the pinned marker holds its last position after detection is lost before it stops updating, 0–10 000 ms. Prevents snapping away on a single missed frame. Default `500`.
- **Assist radius (m)** – *(AI Assisted only)* how close a detection must be, in meters, to a marker's anchor to be picked up. Detections outside this radius are ignored, so the output never jumps to a different performer across the stage. Larger forgives looser anchor aim; smaller demands you keep the anchor tight on the subject. Each marker always follows whichever in-range detection is **nearest** its anchor. Default `1.0`. Depends on accurate camera calibration (run the setup wizard).
- **Spotlight marker** – *(All Performers only)* the controlled marker that follows the performer you choose. **Off** gives every controlled marker to a performer.
- **Re-acquire radius (m)** – *(All Performers only)* how close, in meters, a newcomer must be to where a marker lost its person to resume that marker. `0` turns re-acquiring off, so every newcomer takes the lowest free marker. Default `1.5`. Depends on accurate camera calibration (run the setup wizard).
- **Anchor pull (clip strength) (0–1)** – *(AI Assisted only)* where the output sits **when a person is in range**. `1` clips it exactly onto the detected person (the anchor only chooses *who*); lower values blend the output back toward the anchor. This sets the target only – the glide to that target is governed by **Smoothing** above. Default `0.5`.

**Smoothing**, **Prediction**, and **Grace period** live under **Advanced motion** in the Tracking box; **Follow marker** (Fully Automatic only) and **Track** stay visible.

## Detection Model

Detection quality is a simple choice of tier, from fastest to most accurate. Higher tiers detect people more reliably (especially small, distant, or silhouetted subjects under stage lighting) but need more compute.

- **Fastest** – lowest compute; the right choice on a Raspberry Pi.
- **Fast** – light, quick on modest hardware.
- **Balanced** – good accuracy and speed; the default on a workstation.
- **Accurate** – sharper; needs a workstation.
- **Most Accurate** – best accuracy, heaviest compute.

All five tiers come pre-installed on the macOS app. On a Raspberry Pi the Fastest / Fast / Balanced tiers ship in the image; the heavier Accurate / Most Accurate tiers (which a Pi can't run well anyway) appear grayed out and can be fetched from **Advanced models** on a workstation.

**Advanced models** (collapsed by default) is for everything beyond the tiers: downloading other cataloged models, selecting a model you downloaded yourself, deleting models to free space, and a readout of free / total space on the storage disk. Storage is automatic – model files live in a `models/` folder on the NVMe (`/mnt/nvme/openfollow/yolo`) when a drive is mounted, otherwise a local `yolo` folder under the application working directory. The path is specific to this device, so it is never written into a config export and never overwritten by an import or peer broadcast. (An advanced operator can override it with `detection.storage_path` in `config.toml`.)

## Sensitivity & Overlay

How sensitive detection is, and what the overlay draws.

- **Detection sensitivity (0–1)** – the score a detection must reach to start a new track or be treated as a confident sighting. Lower catches more people but more false positives; higher is stricter. Default `0.2`. Detections that dip just below this threshold are not thrown away: the tracker still uses them to hold an already-tracked person, so an actor stepping into shadow (and dimming the detection) keeps their identity instead of being dropped.
- **Detection rate (FPS)** – how often the model runs: 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, or 30 fps. Higher is more responsive but uses more CPU. Default 15 fps.
- **Maximum people** – maximum detections kept per frame (highest-confidence first). 1–50. Default `10`. Reducing this limits CPU when many people are in view.
- **Show boxes** – draw a bounding rectangle around each detected person. On by default.
- **Show labels** – draw a text label (confidence score) inside or above each box. On by default.
- **Box color** – color of the boxes. Click the swatch to open the color picker. Default gray (`#808080`). A box currently attached to a marker is drawn in **that marker's** color instead, so you can see which detection is driving each followspot.
- **Box thickness (px)** – line weight for the boxes, 1–10 pixels. Default `2`.

**Save** – each box saves on its own. Settings take effect immediately; saving persists them across restarts.
