# Parallelize the suite with pytest-xdist, and cap each worker's native thread
# pools so the two don't multiply.
#
# Worker count is headroom-aware (not ``-n logical``/``-n auto``): small
# CI/Pi runners (≤4 logical CPUs) use every core, but a fat interactive dev
# workstation reserves ~1/3 of its cores so the OS/UI stays responsive – a
# 10-core Mac runs 6 workers and keeps 4 cores free. ``getconf`` is portable
# across macOS/Linux; the ``|| echo 2`` keeps the 2-vCPU CI default if it's
# absent.
#
# Worker count alone is not enough: OpenCV and numpy-BLAS each grow a pool sized
# to the full core count inside every worker, so N workers fan out to N x cores
# threads and freeze an interactive workstation regardless of ``-n``.
# ``PYTEST_THREAD_CAPS`` pins the BLAS/OpenMP pools per worker (Linux/Pi target);
# the OpenCV pool ignores those env vars on macOS and is capped in conftest.py.
#
# ``--dist load`` distributes individual tests across workers; ``loadscope``
# would pin each large module to one worker and bottleneck on the slowest. Safe
# because the suite has no cross-test shared state (function-scoped fixtures,
# ephemeral ports, ``tmp_path`` I/O). pytest-cov combines per-worker coverage, so
# the gate is unaffected. Override with ``PYTEST_PARALLEL=`` for a sequential run,
# or ``PYTEST_WORKERS=N`` to pin the worker count.

# `make mutation` runs `mutmut run` with `[tool.mutmut]` block from

# `tests/test_zone_engine.py`. To audit a different module, edit
# `paths_to_mutate` / `tests_dir` keys and re-run (mutmut 3.x has no CLI
# override). Critical-module shortlist in comment above same block.
#
# Runs are NOT wired into `make ci` – they are too slow (minutes per
# module) and the survivor set is a per-PR sampling tool, not a gate.
# See docs/COVERAGE.md for the policy and how to interpret survivors.
